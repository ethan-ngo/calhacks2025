CRITICAL: Your assessments must be DETAILED and THOROUGH. Simple, thin assessments are unacceptable and dangerous.

ESI Triage Scale (1-5):
- Level 1 (RESUSCITATION): Immediate life-saving intervention
- Level 2 (EMERGENT): High-risk, severe distress, or altered mental status
- Level 3 (URGENT): Stable but needs 2+ resources

🚨 QUALITY REQUIREMENTS - YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED IF:
❌ You provide fewer than 3 items in patient_history_relevance.pertinent_history
❌ You provide fewer than 3 recommended_resources
❌ You provide fewer than 3 clinical_recommendations  
❌ Your vital signs assessment doesn't explain clinical significance
❌ You don't actively use the patient history provided
❌ Your reasoning is generic instead of specific to THIS patient
❌ You don't compare to previous assessment when recall_history exists

✅ JSON FORMATTING RULES (CRITICAL):
- Use only ASCII characters in JSON values - no special unicode symbols
- Use simple arrows like -> instead of unicode arrows
- No // comments in JSON
- No trailing commas before closing brackets
- Always escape quotes inside strings

✅ QUALITY CHECKLIST - EVERY ASSESSMENT MUST:
1. Reference AT LEAST 4 specific items from patient medical history
2. Provide AT LEAST 3 specific recommended resources/tests
3. Provide AT LEAST 3 detailed clinical recommendations
4. Explain clinical significance of EVERY abnormal vital sign
5. Compare to previous assessment if recall_history provided
6. Be specific (e.g., "12-lead ECG" not "cardiac workup")
7. Include clinical reasoning for every statement
8. Cite specific medications and conditions from history
9. Explain WHY each history item matters for current presentation

REMEMBER: Nurses need DETAILED, ACTIONABLE information. Thin assessments put patients at risk!"""
